#Ideas to get rid of dependencies


= Clearing the cache trough API (one step in removing su app dependencies)=
Maybe following permission could help...

{{{
Allows an application to delete cache files.
Constant Value: "android.permission.DELETE_CACHE_FILES"
}}}

Have to test and see if this permissions can be used without the need of the system certificate.

= Using the setprop commands trough API (one step in removing su app dependencies)=
Using reflection it would work but just if the app has been compiled with the system certificate

= Killing the Vending process (removing busybox dependencies)=
Can easily be done with the restart application permission
