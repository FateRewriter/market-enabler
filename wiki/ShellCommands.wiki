= Problem =
There exist certain ways how to drop a shell command from an application.
Some of them end in force close on some circumstances.

= Existing solution =
{{{
Process process = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("su");
DataOutputStream os = new DataOutputStream(process.getOutputStream());
DataInputStream osRes = new DataInputStream(process.getInputStream());
for (String single : commands) {
   os.writeBytes(single + "\n");
   os.flush();
   res.add(osRes.readLine());
}
os.writeBytes("exit\n");
os.flush();
process.waitFor();
}}}

= ideas =
== Execute trough a shell script ==
The application ships with a generic shell script and a normal shell command will be dropped.
{{{
#!/system/bin/sh
# MarketEnabler example set script
# Usage: has to be called with all the values as arguments
setprop gsm.sim.operator.numeric $1
setprop gsm.operator.numeric $2
setprop gsm.sim.operator.iso-country $3
setprop gsm.operator.iso-country $4
setprop gsm.operator.alpha $5
setprop gsm.sim.operator.alpha $6
kill $(ps | grep vending | tr -s ' ' | cut -d ' ' -f2)
rm -rf /data/data/com.android.vending/cache/* 
}}}
As I played on my phone with different ways to execute this commands, this was the only way that executed the commands all times and very fast.
